# Nigerian Financial Logos Downloader

This repository contains Python scripts designed to download and categorise bank logos and biller icons related to Nigerian financial services. The scripts fetch image URLs from external JSON data files and organize the downloaded images into structured folders based on predefined categories.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Categorized Downloads:** Automatically sorts downloaded bank logos into "Commercial Banks," "Microfinance Banks (MFBs)," "Mortgage Banks," "Payment Service Banks (PSBs)," "Merchant Banks," "Finance Companies," "Wallets/Digital Services," and "Others" directories.
* **Biller Icon Organization:** Organizes biller icons into folders corresponding to their respective service categories (e.g., "Internet Data", "Betting", "CableTV", "Electricity", "Transport and Tolls", "Education", "Solar", "eSIM").
* **External Data Source:** Reads bank and biller data from external JSON files (`bank_data.json` and `biller_data.json`), ensuring a clean separation of code and data.
* **Placeholder Image Exclusion:** Intelligently skips downloading generic "Default-Bank.png" placeholder images for bank logos.
* **Robust File Naming:** Sanitizes bank/biller names to create valid and unique filenames, preventing issues with special characters.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the scripts on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* `pip` (Python package installer), which usually comes with Python.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nonsoo24/nigerian-financial-logos-downloader.git](https://github.com/nonsoo24/nigerian-financial-logos-downloader.git)
    cd nigerian-financial-logos-downloader
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

5.  **Prepare Your Data Files:**
    The scripts expect two JSON files in the root directory of the project:

    * **`bank_data.json`**: This file should contain the JSON array of bank data.
        * Create a new file named `bank_data.json` in the `nigerian-financial-logos-downloader` directory.
        * Paste your entire bank JSON data into this file.

    * **`biller_data.json`**: This file should contain the JSON array of biller data.
        * Create a new file named `biller_data.json` in the `nigerian-financial-logos-downloader` directory.
        * Paste your entire biller JSON data into this file.

    **Example `bank_data.json` structure (truncated):**
    ```json
    [
        {
            "bankName": "UBA Bank.",
            "bankCode": "090267",
            "imageUrl": "imageUrl"
        },
        {
            "bankName": "Access Bank",
            "bankCode": "000014",
            "imageUrl": "imageUrl"
        }
        // ... more bank data
    ]
    ```

    **Example `biller_data.json` structure (truncated):**
    ```json
    [
        {
            "category": "Internet Data",
            "billerList": [
                {
                    "billerName": "MTN NG DATA",
                    "billerIcon": "[https://kudatestblob.blob.core.windows.net/kuda-biller-mgmt/011551210304130001596015049401](https://kudatestblob.blob.core.windows.net/kuda-biller-mgmt/011551210304130001596015049401)"
                }
                // ... more biller data
            ]
        }
        // ... more categories and billers
    ]
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can run the scripts from your activated virtual environment.

### Downloading and Categorizing Bank Logos

To download and categorize bank logos:

```bash
python categorized_bank_downloader.py
```



Okay, that's a great idea to put these scripts on GitHub! It makes them easy to share, version control, and potentially improve upon.

Here's a suggestion for your GitHub repository name and a comprehensive README.md file:

Suggested GitHub Repository Name:
nigerian-financial-logos-downloader

Why this name?

nigerian: Clearly indicates the geographical focus of the data.
financial-logos: Describes the type of assets being handled (bank logos, biller icons for financial services).
downloader: Explains the primary action of the scripts.
It's descriptive, concise, and easy to understand.
